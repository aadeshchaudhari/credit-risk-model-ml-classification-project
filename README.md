# 💳 Credit Risk Modeling and Default Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Classification Method

A Machine Learning Powered Credit Risk Assessment System for Smarter Lending Decisions

## 🚀 Project Overview

Credit risk modeling helps financial institutions understand how likely a borrower is to default on a loan.
This project builds a complete credit risk assessment system that predicts the default probability of borrowers, assigns credit scores, and explains the reasons behind each prediction.

It is developed in Python using Streamlit to create an interactive web interface.
The system applies machine learning models, feature engineering, and model interpretability techniques to make the entire process transparent and ready for real-world use.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a machine learning model that predicts loan default risk accurately.

- Make the model explainable so financial teams can trust its output.

- Offer a simple web interface for real-time borrower risk evaluation.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Summary
| Aspect                  | Details                                                |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dataset**             | Imbalanced classification with about 10% defaults      |
| **Feature Engineering** | Domain-based feature creation and statistical analysis |
| **Resampling**          | SMOTE (over-sampling) and under-sampling               |
| **Models Tested**       | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost            |
| **Final Model**         | XGBoost optimized using Optuna                         |
| **Performance**         | AUC: 0.98, Gini: 0.96, KS Statistic: 85.98%            |

  
## 📊 Results

- The model performs very well across accuracy and interpretability metrics.

- Decile analysis shows strong separation between risky and safe borrowers.

- Visual explanations make it easy to understand what drives each prediction.

#### Example visuals include:

AUC-ROC Curve: AUC of 0.99 showing almost perfect classification.


## 🧩 Streamlit Application

The web app allows users to enter borrower and loan details to instantly view:

Default probability

- Credit score

- Credit rating

- Risk insights and explanations

- The interface is interactive, easy to use, and suitable for business demonstrations.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/aadeshchaudhari/credit-risk-model-ml-classification-project.git
cd credit-risk-model-ml-classification-project


### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 4: Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run main.py

## 💡 How to Use

1. After running Streamlit, open the link shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501/).

2. Enter borrower details such as age, income, loan amount, and purpose.

3. Click Calculate Risk to see:

	- Default probability

	- Credit score

	- Credit rating

4. Review the recommendations and explanations generated by the model.

## 🔧 Customization

You can modify the project easily:

- Replace model_data.pkl with your trained model to test new algorithms.

- Update utils.py if your model requires different inputs.

- Edit main.py to adjust the user interface or layout.

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

- End-to-end credit risk modeling pipeline

- Advanced XGBoost model tuned for high performance

- Real-world business application with ready deployment setup

- Clean, modular, and scalable codebase
